# Namaste! 🙏
I'm Om, the human behind the screen. If I were a software, I'd be a mix of spaghetti code and infinite loops, but somehow, I manage to get things done (Kabhi Kabhi).
 
## About Me

- 🌍 Living on Earth, surprisingly (I believe its Flat)
- 💻 Coding like a wizard, or at least trying to 
- 🎮 Procrastinating level: Expert
- 🍕 Pizza enthusiast (because pizza is life)

## Skills

- 💬 Talking to machines (sometimes they listen)
- 🚀 Launching code into space (figuratively)
- 🕹 Playing video games (for research purposes, obviously)
- 🎭 Mastering the art of debugging (and pretending to know what I'm doing)

## Current Project

🤖 Creating a robot to do all my coding for me, so I can focus on more important things like deciding what to have for lunch.

## Fun Facts

- I speak four languages: English, Hindi, Marathi and Emoji.
- My code is like a fine wine - it gets better with time (and lots of debugging).
- I once beat a computer at chess. It was in sleep mode, but I still count it.

## Connect with Me

Let's chat about coding, pizza, or why cats are clearly superior to dogs. Feel free to reach out!

## Random Joke

> "Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because the light attracts bugs!" 😄

Thanks for dropping by! Now, go write some code and remember: Keep it bug-free and sprinkle some humor on it! 🚀
